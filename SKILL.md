# SKILL – CYCLE REPUTE (GRID PANEL EDITION)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CORE ENGINEERING SKILLS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Time-Based State Mutation  
  Implemented dynamic reputation decay calculated using real-time
  hour differentials.

• Algorithmic Score Modeling  
  Designed proportional decay formula and threshold-based tier logic.

• Tier Classification System  
  Multi-level trust system:
  LOW → STANDARD → TRUSTED → ELITE

• Dynamic Recalculation Engine  
  Score auto-adjusts before every render cycle.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CLI SYSTEM DESIGN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Grid-Based ASCII Dashboard Rendering  
  Custom panel layout using box-drawing characters.

• Visual Progress Bar Engine  
  Percentage-based score visualization using █░ characters.

• Structured Command Router  
  Modular switch-based command handling system.

• Runtime History Logger  
  Action tracking with timestamp-based log records.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BACKEND LOGIC ARCHITECTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• In-Memory Stateful Engine  
  Real-time mutation of user objects during execution.

• Controlled Score Floor Enforcement  
  Prevents negative state corruption.

• Crypto-Based ID Generation  
  Secure randomized hex ID via Node.js crypto module.

• Modular Render Layer  
  Separation between logic, render, and interaction layers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM BEHAVIOR MODELING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Decay Model:
  newScore = currentScore − (currentScore × decayRate × hoursElapsed)

• Continuous Recalculation Before Render
